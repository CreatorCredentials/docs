# Key features and benefits

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) introduce a fundamentally new approach to digital authentication, ensuring security, interoperability, and trust in online environments. Creator Credentials extend these principles to the cultural and creative industries, enabling creators and rightsholders to maintain full control over their digital identities and claims.

Here are the essential attributes that make Creator Credentials a game-changer for attribution, rights management, and digital authenticity:

1. Creator Credentials are **self-sovereign**, which means that creators and rightsholders have primary ownership and control over their credentials. They can choose where to host, when to use, and how to share them, including controlling access levels and revoking access if needed.
2. Creator Credentials are **portable**, which means that once issued the holder can transfer credentials between different systems and platforms without loss of information or functionality. They can also be used with various applications or services as required.
3. Creator Credentials are **interoperable**, which means that credentials issued by one system can be recognised and accepted by other systems, even if they are built on different technologies or operated by different organisations. Third party applications can independently verify these credentials.
4. Creator Credentials  can also be **restricted in duration**. This means they support the ability to set expiration dates for verifiable credentials, defining a time limit on how long a verifiable credential is valid. Limited validity can be useful for credentials that expire, such as professional licence or certifications.
5. Creator Credentials  are **revocable**, which means that they can be revoked or cancelled in cases of expiration or other reasons. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the credential system and ensuring that only valid and accurate information is being shared. The revocation can be initiated by the issuer of the credential or by the individual or entity who holds the credential. It can be enforced by the systems that recognise and accept the credential.
6. Creator Credentials are **cryptographically verifiable**, which is essential for the proper attribution of rights, permissions, and restrictions, ensuring transparency and accountability.
7. Creator Credentials are **resilient**. Using them in the context of ISCC declarations, even in cases of content alteration, manipulation, or removal of watermarks or metadata, Creator Credentials can still be derived from the content and its associated ISCC code.
8. Creator Credentials are **publicly accessible**, allowing for verification within the context of any public content declaration or claim.
9. Creator Credentials are **immutable and trustworthy**, meaning they cannot be altered without detection or notice.
10. Creator Credentials are **timestamped** to ensure cryptographic verifiability and transparency and to provide information about who made a declaration and when it was made, both for humans and machines.
