# How Creator Credentials Differ from ISNI and ORCID

Creator Credentials, ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier), and ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier) all serve as identification systems for natural persons, but they differ significantly in functionality, verification, and use cases.

## **Decentralization and Control**

Unlike ISNI and ORCID, which are centrally issued and managed by designated organisations, Creator Credentials operate on the principles of self-sovereign identity. This means that creators and rightsholders have full control over their credentials, choosing where to store them, how to share them, and when to revoke them.

## **Verification and Authentication**

Creator Credentials provide cryptographic verification, allowing creators to prove their identity by presenting their VCs. In contrast, ISNI and ORCID are unique identifiers without built-in cryptographic verification of control.

* **ISNI** focuses on **name disambiguation**, helping libraries, publishers, and media organisations differentiate between individuals with similar names. However, it does not verify identity claims.
* **ORCID** is widely used in **academia and research** to link authors to their published works, but verification is manual and often dependent on institutions.

## **Attribution and Control**

Creator Credentials are designed to work within digital content ecosystems, particularly in the cultural and creative industries. They enhance trust, transparency, and attribution in digital media by allowing creators to control their credentials, securely prove control over their identifier in a machine-readable way.

Creator Credentials allow creators to securely link their identity and rights to their works, ensuring proper attribution and authenticity. This is particularly important in the era of AI-generated content and misinformation, where proving authorship is essential.
