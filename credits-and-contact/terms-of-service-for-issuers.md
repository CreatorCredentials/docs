# Terms of Service for Issuers

### 1. Creator Credentials Services

1. These general terms and conditions ("Terms") apply to users of the Creator Credentials app \[[https://creatorcredentials.app](https://creatorcredentials.app)] and the services offered within this app (collectively the “CC Services”). Third party organisations use the app to confirm credentials of Users as a witness of control of identifying data for Rightsholders and confirm their witnessed knowledge in relation to themselves by issuing a Verified Credential under the VC services (“Issuers”). If You, as an Issuer, use the CC Services, you must comply with these Terms.&#x20;
2. The CC Services are offered by Liccium B.V. to allow Users that can be creators, holders of copyright or related rights, or media organisations (in the following termed “Rightsholders”) to verify themselves and receive VCs.&#x20;
3. Liccium B.V. acts as the “Host” of the application that offers the CC Services. The Host can also act as a witness of control of identifying data of Rightsholders and Issuers, and can also act as an Issuer of Verifiable Credentials (in the following termed “VC”) to confirm their witness knowledge. &#x20;
4. The Host only offers the CC Services to Rightsholders as professionals and Legal Entities in their respective capacity as businesses and professionals in a B2B relationship. The rights of consumers are not affected by these Terms of Service.&#x20;
5. The term of these Terms and Conditions ("Term") in relation to the CC Services commences on the date you accept them and continues until you permanently cease to use the CC Services.&#x20;
6. Updates to the terms have to be accepted. If new terms are not accepted, the Host has the right to terminate the contract. &#x20;

### 2. Legal Relationship between Issuer and Rightsholders/Users

1. The legal relationship between the Issuer and the User/Rightsholder is independent of the relationship between the Host and Rightsholders.&#x20;
2. The Issuer is responsible to apply its own Terms and Conditions in this relationship and must ask Users/Rightsholders for specific consent.&#x20;
3. The Issuer must respect all personal data entrusted by Rightholders to him in full compliance of the Data Protection Rules applicable in this relationship. This may, among other obligations under the jurisdiction applicable in this relationship, include explicit and separate consent for processing the relevant personal data of the Rightsholders/User by You as the Issuer as well as provision of processing information under the laws applicable for the relationship between You as the Issuer and Rightsholders/User.&#x20;

For the avoidance of doubt: Consent of a Rightsholder to Terms and Conditions of the CC Services and/or Data Protection Rules towards the Host does not replace other, separate declarations between You as the Issuer and Rightsholders/Users.
